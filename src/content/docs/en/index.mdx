## Features of Java

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Robust and Secure" icon="seti:lock">
		Java has an exception management and error handling system that helps build stable and secure applications. Additionally, automated memory management through Garbage Collection reduces the risk of memory errors.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Platform Independent" icon="laptop">
		Thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java code is platform-independent. This means a Java program can run on any operating system with the JVM installed (following the principle of "write once, run anywhere").
	</Card>
	<Card title="Object-Oriented" icon="puzzle">
		Java follows the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, which allows structuring code into objects that represent both data and behavior, facilitating code reuse and maintenance.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Multithreading" icon="gitter">
		Java supports multithreading, allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently within a single program, thereby improving performance in applications requiring multitasking.
